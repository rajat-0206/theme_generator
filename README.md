## üìÅ Project Structure

```
theme_generator/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main application file

## üé® Customization

### Adding New Theme Types
To add new theme types, modify the `generateThemesFromPalette` function in the JavaScript code:

```javascript
// Add new theme type
themes.push(createTheme(
    "Your Theme Name",
    "dark|light",
    primaryColor,
    secondaryColor,
    textColor,
    backgroundStyle
));
```

### Modifying Color Processing
Adjust the color extraction algorithm in the `getDominantColors` function:

```javascript
function getDominantColors(pixelData, k) {
    // Modify clustering parameters
    // Adjust color sampling frequency
    // Change color space processing
}
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Image Upload Not Working**
- Ensure the image file is a valid image format (JPG, PNG, GIF)
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify file size is reasonable (< 10MB)

**Theme Generation Fails**
- Try uploading a different image with more distinct colors
- Ensure the image has sufficient color variety
- Check that the image loads completely before processing

**Preview Not Displaying**
- Refresh the page and try again
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled

### Performance Tips
- Use images with clear, distinct colors for better results
- Avoid very large images (resize to < 1000px width/height)
- Close other browser tabs to free up memory
